  <h1>Pairing<h1>

  <h3>12/7/2014<h3>

  <p>
    I think pairing is really useful and helpful when it comes to solving challenges.  The material can be hard to understand most of the times, but when you have two people chipping away at the problem it makes it just a bit easier(not really the right word since nothing is easy).  It's definitely rewarding when there's something were able to help others with when they didn't understand a certain part.  When the code runs and you get the expected output, there's just a really rewarding feeling.  I'm pretty sure every problem that i've done was frustrating to some degree.  <br><br>

    When I receive my feedback, I find it refreshing just because it makes me want to do so much more.  Sometimes I'll pair with someone who will be a lot further than me and understanding it a lot more so I try my best to eventually get there.  Yes, feedback helps a lot because it tells me exactly what I need to work on.  Writing feedback can be difficult because you're trying to give constructive criticism, but typing it through a message sometimes you don't get the correct emotions and it can come out sounding negative, but in reality it's really just things that we need to work on.
