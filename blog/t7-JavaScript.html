    Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects

  <p>
    This week we took our first dive into Java Script, and had been trying to figure out how it's similar and different to the Ruby language.  In Ruby we have a Hash to store keys and values, although in Javascript we have Objects to achieve a similar functionality.  Here are some examples.
  <br><br>
    In Javascript we would first define the object similar to how we would define a regular variable.
  <br><br>
    var dog = {color: "black", name: "hootz", age: "3", breed: "labrador"}
  <br><br>
    In this defined object, we have defined it's variable name as "dog".  The information inside can be called properties, as they are the things that describe this specific dog.  We are easily able to call the value with the associated key by calling on the variable like such: dog.color which would return "black".  We can also add property to the object: variable.property = "value".  For example dog.gender = "male".  This would have added a new property within the object.
  <br><br>
    In ruby we would write this in this following format:
  <br><br>
    dog = {'color' => 'black', 'name' => 'hootz', 'age' => '3', breed => labrador}
