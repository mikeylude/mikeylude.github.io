Classes and ID's

11/10/14

I believe some of the best class and id practices consist of code that don't have redundancy.  When i write code I find myself looking into lines of things that could've been easily done with much less lines.  Having good practice in having CSS on styling documents entirely is a good thing, just so we don't confuse ourselves.  Structuring our design, and being able to present with a clean look is a lot better than having something that's not organized and not designed well.
