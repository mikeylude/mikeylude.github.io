  <h1>Conflict<h1>

  <h3>12/21/14<h3>

  <p>
    Emotional conflicts tend to come up pretty frequently, between friends, work, family, etc.  I do however find that it is most common in a workplace where mindsets do not think a like and that's how conflicts usually begin.  I've had a recent encounter with someone on my team where we disagreed on who had the right approach to fixing another user's machine.  He had an idea to why another user was being constantly locked out of their account during login and I had something completely different in mind. <br><br>
    
    I would usually like to think of myself as an easy going person, and I don't tend to get mad easily.  I usually handle my conflicts by listening to the other person's explanation, but if it seems like it's way out of line or not even close to a solution, I'll usually propose something else.  In this case, my team-mate didn't sound completely wrong, but I had felt that I had a faster and easier fix.  Instead of escalating this to another level, we tried his way of working on it first.  <br><br>
    
    I know what I did made the conflict better, just because of seniority and if I kept shooting his idea down, it would cause an all out outbreak, which is something I don't think is necessary since I'm quitting and preparing myself for the DBC lifestyle.  Not only that, even in any senario, I think it's best to be logical and understand exactly where both parties are coming from before making any decisions to do anything.  <br><br>
    
    If I could go back, I would have done the same thing all over.  Since i've been a rec director back in high school, while taking care of K-5 kids, I've always solved problems the same way, whether it a conflict that included myself, or one's between other individuals.  <br><br>

    What I did take from this experience is that conflict is going to happen no matter where you go.  You can be best friends with the person you're working side by side with, but conflicts will still arise.  The best thing to do is to stay logical, and not blow things out of proportion.  Sometimes, certain individuals aren't logical and can get under my skin, and when it does happen, bring it up with someone else, I just try hard not to lose my cool.  Being in conflict, while both parties are at boiling point has no positive outcome for anyone.
