<h1>DBC Phases and Challenges<h1>

<h3>My thoughts<h3>

<h5>11/02/14<h5>

I'm super excited to begin this DBC journey and one that I will not get else where.  It's taken me about a year of contemplating and second guesses to pull the trigger, but I now know that it is a good decision.  DBC gives us not only the material to become successful in becoming a programmer, but also the social aspect to do well in the field.  The way that it is setup has defnitely caused me to put more time into this, becuase even the instructors keep up with you to make sure you're working and completely the assignments. <br>

I like the way DBC is setup, and totally different than the normal way of learning in a classroom at any university.  I've taken multiple coding classes at San Francisco State University, however it was very tough picking up information from those classes, just because the teachers would use the "copy + paste" method which doesn't really show us what commands due. Having so many pairing sessions really help us talk with one another, and believe this will help build confidence now and when we come out as developers. <br>

It's definitely a big change in terms of culture.  I'm used to going to class, when i'm finished with an assignment, I stop or start relaxing.  However, this is something that we have to be engaged the entire time, and make the most with our time.  The communication channels are all here, and we have a lot of different sources we can get information from.  This is truly different than going to "school". <br>

I'm super excited to be learning different programming languages, in a way that I know will benefit me.  I'm excited to meet the people who are in DBC to benefit themselves or their own personal reasons.  I'm also definitely nervous because i'm leaving my current lifestyle and going somewhere new, but since there are so many others who are doing the same it makes it a lot more reassuring.   <br>
