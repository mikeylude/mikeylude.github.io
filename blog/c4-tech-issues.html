  <h1>Issues in Tech<h1>

  <h3>Communication<h3>

  <h5>12/1/14<h5>

  <p>
    After doing some digging on google, I've found most problems in tech to be artificial intelligence, and things in regards to make our lives easier.  I think one of the most over looked things would have to be communication.  I'm currently in IT, and this is definitely a daily problem while trying to communicate with team members from other offices in other countries, hell even in the same damn city.  People are always on the go, away from seats, helping different users or customers, time zone differences, etc.  These are all valid reasons, how communicating between people can be difficult.  It's even more difficult when the things were trying to communicate on are work based.  There is only so much time within the day, we can't spend every waking minute of it waiting on someone to get the ball rolling.  Meetings are often faced with connection problems or dropped signals which sometimes takes minutes to hours getting reconfigured and fixed before things can continue.  Currently, we are using voice over ip systems, however it's just sound and another application is used for video and vice versa.  <br>

    I do truly believe the first steps in dealing with this issue is to recognize it first.  Many companies do not realize this, but they're creating products that do the same thing over and over, without making big changes to help solve this problem.  I've already seen two application changes within my company this year, which does generally get better and better, but it doesn't really solve anything, but in my opinion is just a work around.  If this is something that can be fixed permanately, I know it'll definitely drive mad revenue, and help many companies produce a lot faster and help them be more in sync.
