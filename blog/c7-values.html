    Affirmation and Stereotype Threat
  <h3><h3>
    12/14/14
  <p>
    In General, I try to live up these values:<br>
    Accomplishment - 5<br>
    Personal development - 5<br>
    Growth - 5<br>
    Responsibility - 5<br>
    Affection - 5<br>
    Romance - 5<br><br>

    Personal development is most important to me because it shapes who I become over time.  With personal development I start the transition of who I used to be, towards the person I want to become.  I think this is one of the traits that can benefit someone most.<br><br>

    The last topic that someone had asked me on was what Christmas gift to choose, probably because I have a good sense on what people like.<br><br>

    I feel like I have a good sense based on the values a chose.  Everything I chose is a big part of what I believe in but I definitely don't think it'll help "mediate sterotype threat".  I don't feel that "values" can mediate that or help in any case.  I think it's based on the person and what their view on it is.<br><br>

    So far I've been feeling down quite often in terms of not being able to keep up with some work, and certain things within my personal life.  I don't think any exercises help, but if we had just looked further and what we want to accomplish and what our end goal is... the grass is greener on the other side.  This goes back to my values: accomplishment.  I can get a second wind and bounce back as I see myself grow into become a better person.
