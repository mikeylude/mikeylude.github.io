    What is Rails?

    Over the course at DBC thus far, we've used a lot of Ruby, cruised through the basics of HTML/CSS, and dug into Javascript a tad bit.  Something that always comes up, is Ruby on Rails.  What is Rails?, well i'll get into a bit more detail today.
    <br><br>
    Rails is a web application development framework which is written in the Ruby Language.  It has been designed to make web programs/applications easier with assumptions that the dev has what they need to get started.  This process is allowing less code to be written, but accomplishing more.  With Rails, we are able to combine the Ruby language with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create web applications that run on web servers.  Since it is ran on a web server, Rails can be classified or considered back-end programming.
    <br><br>
    A web browser combines HTML, CSS, and JS files to display web pages.  The browser gets the files from a web server.  Web servers deliver the HTML, CSS, and JS from static files that are stored on server or from application servers that create the files dynamically from languages such as Ruby.  Rail's combines all these things, like stated previously.<br>
    Web browsers need only 1 HTML file to display a webpage, with the CSS and JS optional as they can be used to help design the layout of the page.  If we want to create serveral web pages, we may want the HTML components to be smaller.  For example, if we were to have content from different databases or places, sometimes it would not be the smartest thing to mix that into our HTML, as it can get kind of messy.
