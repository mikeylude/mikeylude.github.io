        <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
        <h6> 11/16/14</h6>
        <p> The past couple weeks at DBC has definitely proven to be quite the challenge.  I'm having to spend at least 30 hours a week on the material which I find that to be a lot since were still in the beginning.  The biggest struggle for me at this point is definitely not being able to keep up with some concepts.  However, as I start the new week and look back into the previous weeks material, I start to understand it a bit more.  I would say I'm a slow learner, but I can retain the information pretty well.  Time is definitely a struggle, but that's just an excuse as everyone else runs on the same time I do...

          I believe my thinking style would have to be "Concrete Sequential", just becuase I definitely do work well in a in a structured environment.  When I am given strict guidelines and material work based on the material learned, I'll usually get it down pretty quickly.  I definitely follow directions and I don't like doing things on my own process.  Having me to use my imagination and use different methods to solve problems can be a struggle for me as well.

          Overall so far, I think i'm doing decent, not great, but i'll definitely have to kick it into high gear to keep the engine flowing until the end of this program.  I definitely am determined, but i'll give it my all and I know it'll be good.

          I would like to say that I have a growth mindset, but as of now i've slowly drifted into a fixed mindset.  I've been giving up a tad bit easier and getting a bit more frustrated earlier than usual.  My thought process is definitely still in the works and i'm still looking for a better method to train myself to bring up the most positive side of myself.
