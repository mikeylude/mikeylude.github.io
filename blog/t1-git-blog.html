<h1>The Power of Git<h1>

<h3>My experience with the command line<h3>

<h5>11/02/14<h5>

Version control is useful becuase it is a system that allows us to keep track of the changes to make to a file or a set of files over time.  We are able to revert back to a previous version at any time, just incase the most recent changes aren't the exact way you like them.  In our case, if our code isn't working properly, debugging properly, we can revert back to a previous version rather than pulling our hair out trying to figure out how many errors there were, or at least compare.  This seperate version is called creating a branch, which is a copy of the master.  <br>

Git is a version control system, that allows us to do what I wrote in the first paragrpah.  Git enables us to do all of this from our terminal/command line, which is super useful to all users.  It helps us track changes, and allows us to use commands like "git add" to help stage the change, "git commit" to commit a message to show what was changed, to help being organized.  Being able to all this helps us keep track of what is done, and thus makes git important.  <br>

Github allows us to store our files over the net, and can be shared publicly with others.  It is used by a lot of people for collaboration and worked on by groups.  It is THE social media site for programmers!  <br>
