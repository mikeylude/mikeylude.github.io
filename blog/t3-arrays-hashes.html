  <h1>Array's and Hashes<h1>

  <h5>11/16/14<h5>

  <p>
  Throughout the week, working with Ruby has definitely been a struggle. Definitely went more in depth into the language than we did studying for our interview with DBC. Went through a lot of ups and downs with the material and can't say i've fully understood everything, but definitely have a greater sense in the language now. <br>

  Some of the things we learned this week were Array's and Hashes which gets pretty useful in specific situations. Array's can hold objects of any data type. Each one of these elements can be referred to as the index of the array. The first element would start at 0. Starting at 0 is definitely weird since 1 is usually the starting point for.. well... most of everything. <br>

For example an Array can consist of 5 different integers: <br>

nums = [1 , 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>

nums[0] would be 1 <br>

nums[1] would be 2 and so forth <br>

We can also put strings in there : <br>

names = [Mike, Jimmy, John, Ruby, Java] <br>

names[0] would be Mike names[1] would be Jimmy and so forth. <br>

Something else we learned for the week would be hashes. Hashes are a collection of key-value pairs. They are useful when storing the value within the key, so it may display when called. <br>

For example: <br>

fruits = {"apple" => red, "banana" => yellow, "lime" => green} <br>

Definitely have to get more into Hashes, but we've definitely used arrays in a majority of our assignments this week. Looking forward to learning much more with this these coming up weeks!
