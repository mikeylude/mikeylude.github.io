        <p> The Power of Git


Version control is useful becuase it is a system that allows us to keep track of the changes to make to a file or a set of files over time.  We are able to revert back to a previous version at any time, just incase the most recent changes aren't the exact way you like them.  In our case, if our code isn't working properly, debugging properly, we can revert back to a previous version rather than pulling our hair out trying to figure out how many errors there were, or at least compare.  This seperate version is called creating a branch, which is a copy of the master.  

Git is a version control system, that allows us to do what I wrote in the first paragrpah.  Git enables us to do all of this from our terminal/command line, which is super useful to all users.  It helps us track changes, and allows us to use commands like "git add" to help stage the change, "git commit" to commit a message to show what was changed, to help being organized.  Being able to all this helps us keep track of what is done, and thus makes git important.

Github allows us to store our files over the net, and can be shared publicly with others.  It is used by a lot of people for collaboration and worked on by groups.  It is THE social media site for programmers!

       <h1>DBC Phases and Challenges</h1>
        <h6> 11/02/14</h6>


<p>
I'm super excited to begin this DBC journey and one that I will not get else where.  It's taken me about a year of contemplating and second guesses to pull the trigger, but I now know that it is a good decision.  DBC gives us not only the material to become successful in becoming a programmer, but also the social aspect to do well in the field.  The way that it is setup has defnitely caused me to put more time into this, becuase even the instructors keep up with you to make sure you're working and completely the assignments.

I like the way DBC is setup, and totally different than the normal way of learning in a classroom at any university.  I've taken multiple coding classes at San Francisco State University, however it was very tough picking up information from those classes, just because the teachers would use the "copy + paste" method which doesn't really show us what commands due. Having so many pairing sessions really help us talk with one another, and believe this will help build confidence now and when we come out as developers.

It's definitely a big change in terms of culture.  I'm used to going to class, when i'm finished with an assignment, I stop or start relaxing.  However, this is something that we have to be engaged the entire time, and make the most with our time.  The communication channels are all here, and we have a lot of different sources we can get information from.  This is truly different than going to "school".

I'm super excited to be learning different programming languages, in a way that I know will benefit me.  I'm excited to meet the people who are in DBC to benefit themselves or their own personal reasons.  I'm also definitely nervous because i'm leaving my current lifestyle and going somewhere new, but since there are so many others who are doing the same it makes it a lot more reassuring.

          <h1>Classes and ID's</h1>
          <h6>11/10/14</h6>

<p>
I believe some of the best class and id practices consist of code that don't have redundancy.  When i write code I find myself looking into lines of things that could've been easily done with much less lines.  Having good practice in having CSS on styling documents entirely is a good thing, just so we don't confuse ourselves.  Structuring our design, and being able to present with a clean look is a lot better than having something that's not organized and not designed well.

        <h1>Array's and Hashes</h1>
        <h6>11/16/14</h6>

<p>
Throughout the week, working with Ruby has definitely been a struggle.  Definitely went more in depth into the language than we did studying for our interview with DBC.  Went through a lot of ups and downs with the material and can't say i've fully understood everything, but definitely have a greater sense in the language now.  
<br>
Some of the things we learned this week were Array's and Hashes which gets pretty useful in specific situations.  Array's can hold objects of any data type.  Each one of these elements can be referred to as the index of the array.  The first element would start at 0.  Starting at 0 is definitely weird since 1 is usually the starting point for.. well... most of everything.
<br>
For example an Array can consist of 5 different integers:
 <br>
 <br>
 nums = [1 , 2, 3, 4, 5]
<br>
<br>
 nums[0] would be 1
 <br><br>
 nums[1] would be 2 and so forth
<br><br>
 We can also put strings in there : 
<br><br>
 names = [Mike, Jimmy, John, Ruby, Java]
<br><br>
 names[0] would be Mike
 names[1] would be Jimmy and so forth.
<br><br>
 Something else we learned for the week would be hashes.  Hashes are a collection of key-value pairs. They are useful when storing the value within the key, so it may display when called.
<br><br>
 For example:
<br><br>
 fruits = {"apple" => red, "banana" => yellow, "lime" => green}
<br><br>
 Definitely have to get more into Hashes, but we've definitely used arrays in a majority of our assignments this week.  Looking forward to learning much more with this these coming up weeks!
